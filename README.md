Abstract:  The rapid progress in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning has opened unprecedented analytics possibilities in various team and individual sports, including baseball, basketball, and tennis. More recently, AI techniques have been applied to football due to a massive increase in data collection by professional teams, along with increased computational power and advances in machine learning, with the goal of better addressing the new scientific challenges involved in analyzing both individual players’ and coordinated teams’ behaviors. The research challenges associated with predictive and prescriptive football analytics require new developments and progress at the intersection of statistical learning, game theory, and computer vision. 
In this work, we developed a model that helps improve the team's performance and increases the probability of winning a game competition. We developed an algorithm that recommends the positions from which the goalkeeper should kick the ball, allowing his teammates to head the ball. We trained our dataset on three different models and observed how each model reduced overfitting on the dataset. We concluded by highlighting that the Dropout model technique provided a better fit to the dataset, resulting in increased accuracy on the test set.
